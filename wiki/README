FrustraEvo Download README file:

This folder should contain 3 subfolders and this README file. Below a description of the content for each subfolder:

1) AuxFiles
Contains all the intermediate files needed for the processing of the MSA and the software checkpoints.
	* MSA_Clean.fasta is an MSA containing all the sequences
	* PDB_List.txt is a list of all PDBs
	* long.txt is the length of the ungapped MSA 
	* MSA_Chk.fasta is an MSA containing the sequences that have passed all the checks
	* PDB_List.txt is a list of all PDBs that have passed all the checks
	* MSA_Chk_Ref.fasta is an MSA containing the sequences that have passed all the checks and that has two sequences of the reference protein
	* Positions is a matrix containing the positions of each amino acid mapped to the PDB.

2) Data
Contains all frustration calculations and the .r script to calculate frustration.
	* FrustraR.log is a log file containing all the screen outputs generated by the frustration calculation.
	* FrustraR.R is an R script to calculate frustration
	* Modes.log is a log file containing all calculated modes of frustration

3)OutPutFiles
This folder contains all the data that is calculated by the FrustraEvo.
	* CMaps_JobID_Conf.png and CMaps_JobID_Mut.png, are the contact maps for the configuration and mutational index, respectively.
	* FrustrationLogoJobId.png are the sequence and frustration logos (calculated for the singleresidue index).
	* MSFA.png is a Multiple sequence/frustration alignment Color of the cells represent the median of the single residue level frustration (SRLF) index computed with frustratometeR, if MIN is > 0.78, MAX is < -1 and the rest is NEU. The amino acid identities correspond to the consensus sequence and the size of the letter is proportional to SeqIC. 
        * IC_Conf_JobId and IC_Mut_JobId are tables containing the following columns:
		Res: Residue 1 in the interacting pair
		Res: Residue 2 in the interacting pair
		AA1: Amino acid type for Residue 1
		AA2: Amino acid type for Residue 2
		NumRes1_Ref: Residue 1 in the interacting pair (reference numbering)
		NumRes2_Ref: Residue 2 in the interacting pair (reference numbering)
		Prot_Ref: reference protein       
		Conts: number of structures in which the contact is formed
		FreqConts: frequency of structures in which the contact is formed
		pNEU: observed value for neutral
		pMIN: observed value for minimally frustrated
		pMAX: observed value for hihgly frustrated
		HNEU: shannon calculations for neutral 
		HMIN: shannon calculations for minimally frustrated
		HMAX: shannon calculations for hihgly frustrated  
		Htotal: total shannon calculations for all class
		ICNEU: information content for neutral state
		ICMIN: information content for minimally frustrated state 
		ICMAX: information content for hihgly frustrated state
		ICFrust: total information content of the frustration state
		FrustrationState: frustration class
	*IC_SingleRes_JobId
		Res: Residue numbering
		AA_Ref: Amino acid type for Residue in the refrence protein
		Num_Ref: Residue numbering(reference numbering)
		Prot_Ref: reference protein
		%Min: percentage residues that are minimally frustrated
		%Neu: percentage residues that are neutral
		%Max: percentage residues that are highly frustrated
		Min: number of residues that are minimally frustrated
		Neu: number of residues that are neutral
		Max: number of residues that are highly frustrated
		ICMin: information content for minimally frustrated state 
		ICNeu: information content for neutral state
		ICMax: information content for hihgly frustrated state
		ICFrust: total information content of the frustration state
		FrustrationState:  frustration class
